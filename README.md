## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the SpendWise project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**
* **Maven**
* **MySQL Database** (version 8.0 recommended)
* **Git**

### 2. Database Setup

1.  Log into your MySQL client.
2.  Create a new database for the application:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE spendwise_db;
    ```
3.  Update the database connection settings in the Spring Boot application properties (usually `src/main/resources/application.properties` or `application.yml`) to match your local credentials:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spendwise_db
    spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_user
    spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    ```

### 3. Running the Backend

1.  Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
2.  Build the project using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
3.  Run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    # The API will start on: http://localhost:8084
    ```

### 4. Running the Frontend

The frontend is served using simple HTML/CSS/JS.

1.  Ensure the backend is running on `http://localhost:8084`.
2.  Open the `dashboard.html` file in your web browser. (You might need a simple local server extension like Live Server in VS Code for proper functionality, although direct opening often works for simple JS apps).
3.  The application uses `localStorage` to manage the `userId` after a successful simulated login/signup.
